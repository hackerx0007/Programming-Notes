A **program** is a set of instructions written in a specific programming language that tells a computer how to perform a task or solve a problem. These instructions are executed step by step by the computer's processor. In simple terms, a program is like a recipe that guides the computer to do something useful, such as displaying information, solving mathematical problems, or managing files.

Key points:
- A program is made up of code.
- It follows a specific sequence of instructions.
- It can be written in various programming languages like C, Python, Java, etc.
- A computer executes the program to perform tasks. 

### What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a formal language used to write code that provides instructions for a computer to follow. It enables developers to communicate with machines and control their behavior to perform specific tasks. Programming languages have syntax and rules, and examples include C, Python, Java, and JavaScript.

Key points:
- It allows humans to write code for computers.
- Each language has its own syntax and structure.
- Used to create software, websites, and other applications.
### Types of Programming Languages (With Detailed Explanation and Examples)

#### 1. **Procedural Programming**
   - **What it is:** Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that uses a step-by-step approach to break down tasks into functions or procedures. Each function performs a specific task and can be reused throughout the program.
   - **Example:** C, Pascal, Fortran.

   ```c
   // Example in C
   #include <stdio.h>

   void greet() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
   }

   int main() {
       greet();  // calling the greet function
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   - **Key Features:** 
     - Focuses on functions and procedures.
     - Step-by-step execution.

---

#### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **What it is:** OOP organizes code into objects and classes. Objects are instances of classes, which can contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data.
   - **Example:** C++, Java, Python.

   ```cpp
   // Example in C++
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   class Car {
   public:
       string brand;
       void showBrand() {
           cout << "Car Brand: " << brand << endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Car myCar;
       myCar.brand = "Toyota";
       myCar.showBrand();  // calling method on object
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Focuses on objects and classes.
     - Concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

---

#### 3. **Functional Programming**
   - **What it is:** Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It avoids changing state and mutable data.
   - **Example:** Haskell, Lisp, Scala.

   ```haskell
   -- Example in Haskell
   square x = x * x

   main = print (square 5)  -- Output: 25
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Emphasizes immutability.
     - Functions are first-class citizens.

---

#### 4. **Logic Programming**
   - **What it is:** Logic programming is based on formal logic. Programs consist of facts and rules, and the system tries to infer conclusions based on them.
   - **Example:** Prolog.

   ```prolog
   % Example in Prolog
   parent(tom, jerry).
   parent(jerry, spike).

   grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).

   % Query: grandparent(tom, spike). -> true
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Focuses on what should be achieved, rather than how.
     - Based on facts and rules.

---

#### 5. **Scripting Languages**
   - **What it is:** Scripting languages are used for automating tasks. These languages are often interpreted, meaning the code is executed line by line rather than being compiled.
   - **Example:** JavaScript, Python, PHP.

   ```javascript
   // Example in JavaScript
   function greet() {
       console.log("Hello, World!");
   }

   greet();  // calling the function
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Easy to write and execute.
     - Often used for web development and automation.

---

#### 6. **Markup Languages**
   - **What it is:** While not strictly programming languages, markup languages are used to define the structure and presentation of data.
   - **Example:** HTML, XML.

   ```html
   <!-- Example in HTML -->
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>My Web Page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Defines structure rather than logic.
     - Used in web design and data representation.

### First C Program: "Hello, World!"

Here's a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This program demonstrates the basic structure of a C program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor directive to include the standard input/output library

int main() {  // Main function - execution starts here
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

### Explanation

- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: This line includes the standard input/output library, which is necessary for using the `printf` function.
- **`int main()`**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. The execution of the program starts from here.
- **`printf("Hello, World!\n");`**: This line prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console. The `\n` adds a newline at the end.
- **`return 0;`**: This statement ends the `main` function and returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully.

### Running the Program

1. **Save the Code**: Save the code in a file named `hello.c`.
2. **Compile the Code**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `hello.c` is saved.
   - Compile the program using:
     - `gcc hello.c -o hello` (for GCC)
     - `clang hello.c -o hello` (for Clang)
3. **Run the Executable**:
   - On Unix-like systems: `./hello`
   - On Windows: `hello.exe`

This will display "Hello, World!" on the console.   ```

### Components of a C Program

A C program typically consists of several key components:

1. **Preprocessor Directives**
   - **Description:** Lines that begin with `#` and are processed by the preprocessor before compilation.
   - **Example:** `#include <stdio.h>` (includes the standard input/output library).

2. **Main Function**
   - **Description:** The entry point of a C program. Execution starts here.
   - **Syntax:** `int main() { /* code */ return 0; }`
   - **Example:** 
     ```c
     int main() {
         // code here
         return 0;
     }
     ```

3. **Function Definitions**
   - **Description:** Blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Functions can be called from the main function or other functions.
   - **Syntax:** `return_type function_name(parameters) { /* code */ }`
   - **Example:**
     ```c
     void greet() {
         printf("Hello, World!\n");
     }
     ```

4. **Variable Declarations**
   - **Description:** Statements that define variables and their types. They must be declared before use.
   - **Syntax:** `type variable_name;`
   - **Example:** `int age;`

5. **Statements and Expressions**
   - **Description:** Instructions that perform operations or control the flow of execution.
   - **Syntax:** `statement;`
   - **Example:** `printf("Hello, World!\n");`

6. **Comments**
   - **Description:** Non-executable text used to explain code. Comments are ignored by the compiler.
   - **Syntax:** Single-line (`// comment`) or multi-line (`/* comment */`)
   - **Example:**
     ```c
     // This is a single-line comment
     /*
       This is a multi-line comment
     */
     ```

7. **Header Files**
   - **Description:** Files that contain declarations for functions and macros used in the program.
   - **Example:** `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions.

8. **Libraries**
   - **Description:** Collections of pre-written code that provide functionalities like mathematical operations, file handling, etc.
   - **Example:** The Standard Library (`stdlib.h`, `math.h`).

### Example C Program with Components

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor Directive

// Function Definition
void greet() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

int main() {  // Main Function
    int number = 5;  // Variable Declaration and Initialization
    greet();  // Function Call
    printf("Number: %d\n", number);  // Statement
    return 0;  // Return Statement
}
```

- **Preprocessor Directive:** `#include <stdio.h>`
- **Function Definition:** `void greet()`
- **Main Function:** `int main()`
- **Variable Declaration:** `int number = 5;`
- **Statements:** `greet();` and `printf("Number: %d\n", number);`
- **Comments:** (none in the example, but you can add them to explain code)

### Explanation of the Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    /* MY first program */
    printf("Hallo world ");
    return 0;
}
```

#### 1. **Preprocessor Directive**
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This line tells the compiler to include the standard input/output library before compiling the program. The `stdio.h` header file contains declarations for input and output functions, such as `printf`.

#### 2. **Main Function**
   ```c
   int main() {
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This is the entry point of the program. The execution of the program starts from this function. `int` indicates that the function returns an integer value.

#### 3. **Comment**
   ```c
   /* MY first program */
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This is a multi-line comment. It is ignored by the compiler and is used to provide information or notes within the code. In this case, it notes that this is the programmer's first program.

#### 4. **Function Call**
   ```c
   printf("Hallo world ");
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This line uses the `printf` function from the `stdio.h` library to print the text "Hallo world " to the console. The `printf` function is used for outputting data to the standard output (usually the terminal or console).

#### 5. **Return Statement**
   ```c
   return 0;
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This statement ends the `main` function and returns 0 to the operating system. Returning 0 typically indicates that the program executed successfully.

### Summary

- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: Includes the standard I/O library for input and output functions.
- **`int main()`**: Defines the main function where program execution starts.
- **`/* MY first program */`**: A comment explaining that this is the first program.
- **`printf("Hallo world ");`**: Prints "Hallo world " to the console.
- **`return 0;`**: Ends the program and returns 0, indicating success.

This code demonstrates the basic structure of a C program, including how to include libraries, define a main function, use comments, print output, and return a value.

### What is Syntax?

**Syntax** refers to the set of rules and structure that govern the formation of statements and expressions in a programming language. It defines how symbols, keywords, and operators should be arranged to create valid code.

#### Key Points About Syntax

1. **Rules for Writing Code**
   - **Description:** Syntax dictates how code must be written to be understood by the compiler or interpreter.
   - **Example:** In C, every statement must end with a semicolon (`;`).

2. **Structure and Format**
   - **Description:** Syntax includes the correct arrangement of elements like keywords, operators, and punctuation.
   - **Example:** The `if` statement in C requires parentheses around the condition and curly braces around the block of code.
     ```c
     if (condition) {
         // code to execute
     }
     ```

3. **Error Detection**
   - **Description:** Syntax errors occur when code does not follow the rules of the language, leading to compilation or runtime errors.
   - **Example:** Forgetting a semicolon at the end of a statement in C will result in a syntax error.

4. **Language-Specific**
   - **Description:** Each programming language has its own syntax rules.
   - **Example:** The syntax for declaring a variable in C is `type variable_name;`, whereas in Python, it is simply `variable_name = value`.

#### Examples of Syntax in C

1. **Variable Declaration**
   ```c
   int age;  // Correct syntax for declaring an integer variable
   ```

2. **Function Definition**
   ```c
   void greet() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
   }
   ```

3. **Conditional Statement**
   ```c
   if (age > 18) {
       printf("Adult\n");
   } else {
       printf("Minor\n");
   }
   ```

4. **Loop Statement**
   ```c
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       printf("%d\n", i);
   }
   ```

In summary, syntax defines how code should be structured and written in a programming language to ensure it is correctly interpreted and executed by the compiler or interpreter.

### What is a Token in Programming?

A **token** in programming is a basic, individual unit of syntax that the compiler or interpreter uses to understand and process the code. Tokens are the building blocks of programming languages and are typically classified into several categories.

#### Types of Tokens

1. **Keywords**
   - **Description:** Reserved words in a programming language that have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names).
   - **Examples:** `int`, `return`, `if`, `else`, `while` in C.

   ```c
   int main() {  // 'int' and 'main' are keywords
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Identifiers**
   - **Description:** Names given to variables, functions, arrays, etc., that are defined by the programmer.
   - **Examples:** `age`, `sum`, `calculateTotal`.

   ```c
   int age = 25;  // 'age' is an identifier
   ```

3. **Constants**
   - **Description:** Literal values that are used directly in the code.
   - **Examples:** Numeric constants (e.g., `100`, `3.14`), string constants (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).

   ```c
   int x = 100;  // '100' is a numeric constant
   ```

4. **Operators**
   - **Description:** Symbols that represent operations to be performed on operands.
   - **Examples:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `!=`.

   ```c
   int sum = a + b;  // '+' is an operator
   ```

5. **Punctuation (Separators)**
   - **Description:** Symbols used to separate or terminate statements and expressions.
   - **Examples:** `;` (semicolon), `{}`, `()`, `,` (comma).

   ```c
   printf("Hello, World!\n");  // ';' is a punctuation mark
   ```

6. **Comments**
   - **Description:** Text in the code that is ignored by the compiler but is useful for documentation and explanation.
   - **Examples:** `//` (single-line comment), `/* */` (multi-line comment).

   ```c
   // This is a single-line comment
   /* This is a 
      multi-line comment */
   ```

#### Example in C

Here's a simple C program with tokens highlighted:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // #include, <stdio.h>, and // are tokens

int main() {  // int, main, (), {}, and ; are tokens
    int age = 25;  // int, age, =, 25, and ; are tokens
    printf("Age: %d\n", age);  // printf, "Age: %d\n", age, and ; are tokens
    return 0;  // return, 0, and ; are tokens
}
```

In this example:
- **Keywords:** `int`, `return`
- **Identifiers:** `main`, `age`
- **Constants:** `25`, `"Age: %d\n"`
- **Operators:** `=`, `,`
- **Punctuation:** `;`, `{}`, `()`

Tokens are essential for the syntax analysis phase of compilation, where the compiler breaks down code into meaningful components to generate executable instructions.
