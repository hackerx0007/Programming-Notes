### What is a Program?

A **program** is a set of instructions written in a specific programming language that tells a computer how to perform a task or solve a problem. These instructions are executed step by step by the computer's processor. In simple terms, a program is like a recipe that guides the computer to do something useful, such as displaying information, solving mathematical problems, or managing files.

Key points:
- A program is made up of code.
- It follows a specific sequence of instructions.
- It can be written in various programming languages like C, Python, Java, etc.
- A computer executes the program to perform tasks. 

### What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a formal language used to write code that provides instructions for a computer to follow. It enables developers to communicate with machines and control their behavior to perform specific tasks. Programming languages have syntax and rules, and examples include C, Python, Java, and JavaScript.

Key points:
- It allows humans to write code for computers.
- Each language has its own syntax and structure.
- Used to create software, websites, and other applications.

### Types of Programming Languages (With Detailed Explanation and Examples)

#### 1. **Procedural Programming**
   - **What it is:** Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that uses a step-by-step approach to break down tasks into functions or procedures. Each function performs a specific task and can be reused throughout the program.
   - **Example:** C, Pascal, Fortran.

   ```c
   // Example in C
   #include <stdio.h>

   void greet() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
   }

   int main() {
       greet();  // calling the greet function
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   - **Key Features:** 
     - Focuses on functions and procedures.
     - Step-by-step execution.

---

#### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **What it is:** OOP organizes code into objects and classes. Objects are instances of classes, which can contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data.
   - **Example:** C++, Java, Python.

   ```cpp
   // Example in C++
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   class Car {
   public:
       string brand;
       void showBrand() {
           cout << "Car Brand: " << brand << endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Car myCar;
       myCar.brand = "Toyota";
       myCar.showBrand();  // calling method on object
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Focuses on objects and classes.
     - Concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

---

#### 3. **Functional Programming**
   - **What it is:** Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It avoids changing state and mutable data.
   - **Example:** Haskell, Lisp, Scala.

   ```haskell
   -- Example in Haskell
   square x = x * x

   main = print (square 5)  -- Output: 25
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Emphasizes immutability.
     - Functions are first-class citizens.

---

#### 4. **Logic Programming**
   - **What it is:** Logic programming is based on formal logic. Programs consist of facts and rules, and the system tries to infer conclusions based on them.
   - **Example:** Prolog.

   ```prolog
   % Example in Prolog
   parent(tom, jerry).
   parent(jerry, spike).

   grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).

   % Query: grandparent(tom, spike). -> true
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Focuses on what should be achieved, rather than how.
     - Based on facts and rules.

---

#### 5. **Scripting Languages**
   - **What it is:** Scripting languages are used for automating tasks. These languages are often interpreted, meaning the code is executed line by line rather than being compiled.
   - **Example:** JavaScript, Python, PHP.

   ```javascript
   // Example in JavaScript
   function greet() {
       console.log("Hello, World!");
   }

   greet();  // calling the function
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Easy to write and execute.
     - Often used for web development and automation.

---

#### 6. **Markup Languages**
   - **What it is:** While not strictly programming languages, markup languages are used to define the structure and presentation of data.
   - **Example:** HTML, XML.

   ```html
   <!-- Example in HTML -->
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>My Web Page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   - **Key Features:**
     - Defines structure rather than logic.
     - Used in web design and data representation.

These detailed descriptions and examples cover the major types of programming languages based on their paradigms, helping you understand their purpose and structure.
